Baachelor's final thesis.

Abstract:
Object detection is technology of computer 
vision and image processing which deals with detection 
of instances of semantic objects of particular classes in 
digitalized images and videos. Outline of this paper is a 
system for detecting the type of obstacle; converting text 
into audio for reading purpose and detecting the kind of 
obstacle for blind people using Raspberry pi3.This 
technique helps the blind people to see the world 
virtually with an audio output. Optical Character 
Recognition (OCR) algorithm can be used to translate 
print version or hand-written text into audio output 
using Raspberry Pi. Ultrasonic sensors are attached with 
motor which detects the presence of obstacle in 180°. In 
this proposed model Raspberry pi3 is the medium which 
provides interface between Ultrasonic sensor and 
camera, which is implemented to provide the required 
output to the blind user that can be listened through 
headphones.
